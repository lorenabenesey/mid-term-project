# mid-term-project
Introduction to the Mid-term project
In this project, you’re going to be building and deploying your first fully responsive website using the technologies you’ve learned so far: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Later in the course, you’re going to learn how to create more complex web applications using Vue.js on top of JavaScript. However, it’s important that you practice the basic coding skills you’ve learned so far before moving on to more complex tasks.


Technical Requirements
Your website should be rendered in a browser.
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files.
Have a repo on GitHub.
Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
Be deployed online using Netlify so that anybody can access it.
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
In summary, for this project, you’ll have to recreate a pre-existing design using your HTML & CSS skills. You’ll also have to create a few interactions with the DOM, using what you’ve learned about JavaScript so far.

Finally, you’ll have to deploy this project to Netlify, using the Git CLI to do so. When you’re finished, you’ll have your first website live and ready for anyone to interact with it!


Deliverables
The URL of the GitHub repository for your project.
The URL of the live website on the Internet.
The URL of the slides for your project presentation.
You must present your project during Mid-term final presentations.

Project assets
For this project, you’ll have access to the following assets:

A Figma design that you will have to turn into a live, responsive website. This design also includes a few specifications regarding fonts and colors
A folder with all the images you will need for this project.

You can download all assets from the following project assets Google Drive folder.


Project description
You’ll be building a website for a fictional web design company. This includes a few pages:

a home,
a “project” page and
a contact page with a form.
Some of the challenges you’ll have to complete will be the following:

adding navigation between the pages.
making all the fields in the contact form required before being able to submit it.
(bonus) adding animations to different sections, like the “recent projects” cards.

Setup
Besides your usual IDE, you will need to create a Figma account in order to open up the design that you’re going to replicate. Creating an account is completely free.

We recommend you download the desktop Figma app for this project. Once you’ve created your account and downloaded the software, you just need to import the .fig file you’ll see inside the Assets folder and you’ll be set.

We’re going to review the basics of Figma together; but if you want to dive deeper into the use of this software, you can watch this introductory video.


Quick summary on how to use Figma
During a real-world web development project, most of the time you’ll have to use the design file you get in order to build a website. Here are some of the tasks you’ll have to do in most of your projects:

Export the assets you’re going to use.
Review styles (sizes, margins, fonts, colors, etc.).
Before starting the project, we’re going to review the basics of Figma just so you know exactly how to use it in order to create your first responsive website.


Web responsiveness
As is the case with most professional projects, for this task you’ve received a design prepared for a desktop screen. However, as you know by now, you always need to keep mobile devices in mind.

One of the main challenges of this project is to adapt the existing design to all screen sizes. You are free to modify any aspect of the website as you see fit in order to make it compatible with mobile devices.


Deployment
The last task of this project is to actually deploy your website once it’s completed. For this particular project, we’ll be using Netlify, a static web page hosting service.

Deploying to Netlify is pretty simple: you just need to create an account, connect it to your Github repository and enter a few commands in your CLI; and you’re good to go.

However, here’s a guide showing you how to deploy a static website using this service that you can follow once your project is completed.


Presentations
For each of the projects you create at Ironhack, you will also have to make a presentation about it. Communication (including public speaking) is an important skill to practice for finding your first developer job after Ironhack and for later.

Format
Talking with Slides: 3 minutes
Demo: 2 minutes
Total: 5 minutes
Slide Applications
All presentations will be done from a staff member’s computer, so your slides need to be online.
PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind will not be accepted.
Suggested online slide applications:
Slides
Prezi
Google Slides
Presentation Structure
Title Slide (1 slide): your project’s name & your name
About Me (1-2 slides):
Where are you from?
What are some interesting facts about you? (hobbies, travels, etc.)
Project Elevator Pitch (1-2 slides):
What is your project?
How does it work?
Why did you choose it?
Technical Challenge (1-2 slides):
What was the most important technical challenge you faced?
How did you overcome that challenge?
Big Mistake (1-2 slides):
What was the biggest mistake you made during this project?
What did you learn from it?
Demo Slide (1 slide): literally says “DEMO” with a link to your project so you can open it easily
Closing Slide (1 slide): your project’s name, your name & a “Thank You”
Total: 7-11 slides
Presentation Structure Notes
Don’t include a slide just for the technologies.
Don’t include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
Don’t include a slide for GitHub graphs.
Don’t go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.
If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don’t know what to do.
Demo Tips
Plan what you are going to demo and practice it on the live site. That way you won’t be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
Deploy early so you can squash bugs. There are always bugs on the live site at first.
Add a link to your live project to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.
Your app’s colors and sizing might look different on the projector. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.

Project Feedback and Evaluation
Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity and semantic naming?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score	Expectations
0	Didn’t meet expectations
1	Met expectations, good job!
2	Exceeded expectations, you magnificent creature, you!
You should use the feedback to focus on what needs to be improved for the next project.


Good luck! :heart:
